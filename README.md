This is a logical calculator (yeah, it's called BoolBoolator because it solves boolean functions :D )

It's my first project that's something about serious, so it needs to be improved in some things (if you test it, you'll see them)

The file "main.py" is to be run, "module.py" contains the main class which solves all the things here, and other files are for the interface.
