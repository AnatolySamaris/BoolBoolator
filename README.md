## You can install the BoolBoolator if you download the BoolBoolatorSetup.exe file

This is a logical calculator (yeah, it's called BoolBoolator because it solves boolean functions :D )

It's my first project that's something about serious, so it needs to be improved in some things (if you test it, you'll see them)

The file "main.py" is to be run, "module.py" contains the main class which solves all the things here, and other files are for the interface.

Here are screenshots of the BoolBoolator:

The first that you see when open the BoolBoolator is... a common calculator interface:

Let's enter something using the buttons here (you can also insert some copied expression into the input line):

Press the '=' button and...

Well, here's all what can be useful when you're solving boolean expressions
If you press 'Далее' button, you'll get an addicional information about the expression:

Yeah, Pier and Schaeffer basises are not completed now, so they'll be able to be used soon.
As you could notice, you can copy all of these results (except the truth table and Carnot card) to insert them somewhere.

For example, there's my Discrete Mathematics homework, that is done only with my BoolBoolator:
