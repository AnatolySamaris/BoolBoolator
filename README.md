## You can install BoolBoolator. Look for an .exe file in releases.

This is a logical calculator (yeah, it's called BoolBoolator because it solves boolean functions :D )

It's my first project that's something about serious, so it needs to be improved in some things (if you test it, you'll see them)

The file "main.py" is to be run, "dealwithbool.py" contains the main class which solves all the things here, and other files are for the interface.

Here are screenshots of the BoolBoolator:

The first that you see when open the BoolBoolator is... a common calculator interface:

Let's enter something using the buttons here (you can also insert some copied expression into the input line):

Press the '=' button and we got two windows: the first represents a table of function values for every possible set of values and the second gives us some useful information about the function:

Well, here's all what can be useful when you're solving boolean expressions, except pnf minimization that will be implemented in future version.
As you could notice, you can copy all of these results (except the truth table and Carnot card) to insert them somewhere.

Also you can just write some simple boolean expression containing zeros and ones and the BoolBoolator will return the result of the expression in the same window:

For example, there's my Discrete Mathematics homework, that is done only with my BoolBoolator:
